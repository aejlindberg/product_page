# Built a Product Listing with React

Read the list of products from a JSON file and used that to render a React component for each product.

Iterated over the array and render a component for each product to build up the page from a reusable component. Every product listing  have the following data rendered:

* `name`
* `price`
* `type`
* `size`
* `numberInPack`
* `deliveryTime`
* `image`
* `substance`

1. Added more information about the product on hover.
2. Add information to the listing that tells how many products are showing.
